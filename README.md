## Java OOPs
Location: [`/java-oops`](./java-oops)

Covers **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** with practical QA-related examples:
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction & Encapsulation

---

## Java Advanced Concepts
Location: [`/java-advanced`](./java-advanced)

Explores more advanced Java concepts used in automation:
- Collections Framework (List, Set, Map)
- Exception Handling
- Streams & Lambda Expressions
- File Handling

---

## Selenium Basics
Location: [`/selenium-basics`](./selenium-basics)

Covers the fundamentals of **Selenium WebDriver**:
- Locators (ID, Name, XPath, CSS)
- Browser actions (click, type, select)
- Handling Alerts, Frames, Windows
- Waits (Implicit, Explicit, Fluent)

---

## Test Automation Framework
Location: [`/test-automation-framework`](./test-automation-framework)

Implements a **Page Object Model (POM) based framework** using:
- **Java + Selenium + TestNG**
- **Maven** for build management
- **Log4j** for logging
- **Extent Reports / Allure Reports** for reporting
- **Screenshot capture** on pass/fail

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/java-selenium-learning.git
   cd java-selenium-learning
   ```
2. Open in an IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse).
3. Install dependencies via Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run test cases:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add Hybrid Framework (Data-Driven + Keyword-Driven)
- Integrate with Jenkins for CI/CD
- API Automation (Rest Assured / Postman)
- Cypress Automation Projects (future repo)
